A Serverless v1.x plugin to build your lambda functions with [Webpack][link-webpack].

This plugin is for you if you want to use the latest Javascript version with [Babel][link-babel];
use custom [resource loaders][link-webpack-loaders];
try your lambda functions locally and much more!

> **BREAKING CHANGE IN v2**: `webpack` must now be installed alongside `serverless-webpack` as a peer dependency. This allows more control over which version of Webpack to run.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install serverless-webpack --save-dev
```

Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-webpack
```

## Configure

By default the plugin will look for a `webpack.config.js` in the service directory.
Alternatively, you can specify a different file or configuration in `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
custom:
  webpack: ./folder/my-webpack.config.js
```

An base Webpack configuration might look like this:

```js
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  entry: './handler.js',
  target: 'node',
  module: {
    loaders: [ ... ]
  }
};
```

### serverless-webpack lib export helper

serverless-webpack exposes a lib object, that can be used in your webpack.config.js
to make the configuration easier and to build fully dynamic configurations.

#### Automatic entry resolution

You can let the plugin determine the correct handler entry points at build time.
Then you do not have to care anymore when you add or remove functions from your service:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const slsw = require('serverless-webpack');

module.exports = {
  ...
  entry: slsw.lib.entries,
  ...
};
```

Custom entries that are not part of the SLS build process can be added too:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const _ = require('lodash');
const slsw = require('serverless-webpack');

module.exports = {
  ...
  entry: _.assign({
    myCustomEntry1: './custom/path/something.js'
  }, slsw.lib.entries),
  ...
};
```

#### Full customization (for experts)

The lib export also provides the `serverless` and `options` properties, through
which you can access the Serverless instance and the options given on the command-line.

This enables you to have a fully customized dynamic configuration, that can evaluate
anything available in the Serverless framework. There are really no limits.

Samples are: The current stage and the complete service definition. You thereby
have access to anything that a Serverless plugin would have access to.

Both properties should be handled with care and should never be written to,
as that will modify the running framework and leads to unpredictable behavior!

If you have cool use cases with the full customization, we might add your solution
to the plugin examples as showcase.

### Output

Note that, if the `output` configuration is not set, it will automatically be
generated to write bundles in the `.webpack` directory. If you set your own `output`
configuration make sure to add a [`libraryTarget`][link-webpack-libtarget]
for best compatibility with external dependencies:

```js
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  // ...
  output: {
    libraryTarget: 'commonjs',
    path: '.webpack',
    filename: 'handler.js', // this should match the first part of function handler in `serverless.yml`
  },
  // ...
};
```

### Node modules / externals

By default, the plugin will try to bundle all dependencies. However, you don't
want to include all modules in some cases such as selectively import, excluding
builtin package (ie: `aws-sdk`) and handling webpack-incompatible modules.

In this case you might add external modules in
[Webpack's `externals` configuration][link-webpack-externals].
Those modules can be included in the Serverless bundle with the `webpackIncludeModules`
option in `serverless.yml`:

```js
// webpack.config.js
var nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals')

modules.export = {
  // we use webpack-node-externals to excludes all node deps.
  // You can manually set the externals too.
  externals: [nodeExternals()],
}
```

```yaml
# serverless.yml
custom:
  webpackIncludeModules: true # enable auto-packing of external modules
```

All modules stated in `externals` will be excluded from bundled files. If an excluded module
is stated as `dependencies` in `package.json`, it will be packed into the Serverless
artifact under the `node_modules` directory.

By default, the plugin will use the `package.json` file in working directory, If you want to
use a different package file, set `packagePath` to your custom `package.json`:

```yaml
# serverless.yml
custom:
  webpackIncludeModules:
    packagePath: '../package.json' # relative path to custom package.json file.
```
> Note that only relative path is supported at the moment.

You can find an example setups in the [`examples`][link-examples] folder.

## Usage

### Automatic bundling

The normal Serverless deploy procedure will automatically bundle with Webpack:

- Create the Serverless project with `serverless create -t aws-nodejs`
- Install Serverless Webpack as above
- Deploy with `serverless deploy`

### Usage with serverless-offline

The plugin integrates very well with [serverless-offline][link-serverless-offline] to
simulate AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway locally.

Add the plugins to your `serverless.yml` file and make sure that `serverless-webpack`
precedes `serverless-offline` as the order is important:
```yaml
  plugins:
    ...
    - serverless-webpack
    ...
    - serverless-offline
    ...
```

Run `serverless offline` or `serverless offline start` to start the Lambda/API simulation.

In comparison to `serverless offline`, the `start` command will fire an `init` and a `end` lifecycle hook which is needed for `serverless-offline` and e.g. `serverless-dynamodb-local` to switch off resources (see below).

You can find an example setup in the [`examples`][link-examples] folder.

#### Custom paths

If you do not use the default path and override it in your Webpack configuration,
you have use the `--location` option.

#### serverless-dynamodb-local

Configure your service the same as mentioned above, but additionally add the `serverless-dynamodb-local`
plugin as follows:
```yaml
  plugins:
    - serverless-webpack
    - serverless-dynamodb-local
    - serverless-offline
```

Run `serverless offline start`.

#### Other useful options

You can reduce the clutter generated by `serverless-offline` with `--dontPrintOutput` and
disable timeouts with `--noTimeout`.

### Run a function locally

To run your bundled functions locally you can:

```bash
$ serverless webpack invoke --function <function-name>
```

Options are:

- `--function` or `-f` (required) is the name of the function to run
- `--path` or `-p` (optional) is a JSON file path used as the function input event

### Run a function locally on source changes

Or to run a function every time the source files change use `watch`:

```bash
$ serverless webpack watch --function <function-name> --path event.json
```

Options are:

- `--function` or `-f` (required) is the name of the function to run
- `--path` or `-p` (optional) is a JSON file path used as the function input event

### Bundle with webpack

To just bundle and see the output result use:

```bash
$ serverless webpack --out dist
```

Options are:

- `--out` or `-o` (optional) The output directory. Defaults to `.webpack`.

### Simulate API Gateway locally

_The integrated simulation functionality will be removed in version 3 in favor of
using `serverless-offline` (see [#135][link-135]) which already does the job
perfectly and fully integrates with `serverless-webpack`.
Please switch to `serverless-offline` if you do not use it already._

To start a local server that will act like API Gateway, use the following command.
Your code will be reloaded upon change so that every request to your local server
will serve the latest code.

```bash
$ serverless webpack serve
```

Options are:

- `--port` or `-p` (optional) The local server port. Defaults to `8000`

The `serve` command will automatically look for the local `serverless.yml` and serve
all the `http` events. For example this configuration will generate a GET endpoint:

```yaml
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http:
          method: get
          path: hello
```

## Example with Babel

In the [`examples`][link-examples] folder there is a Serverless project using this
plugin with Babel. To try it, from inside the example folder:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `serverless webpack run -f hello` to run the example function
